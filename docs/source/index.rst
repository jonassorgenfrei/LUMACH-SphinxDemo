Welcome to Lumache's documentation!
===================================

**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers that
creates recipes mixing random ingredients.  It pulls data from the `Open Food
Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_ and offers a *simple* and
*intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including how to
:ref:`install <installation>` the project.
